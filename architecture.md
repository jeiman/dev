## Software Architecture 

### Best Practices

- Instead of being built to last, it is built to CHANGe
- Before any components can be designed, the software architect must clearly understand the needs of the user and the domain
- The software architect must identify the subsystems in the product after which he should consider components and layers and abstract them so as to identify every key interface therein
- Using an iterative and incremental approach to designing the software architecture is a great idea
- Use lessons learned from history, record every decision you make and conclusively mitigate major risks.
- Under investing in software architecture is not an option
